Adventure on the Chattooga Trail

I created this simple text-based adventure game for the Girls Engineering and Coding Organization (GECO) Club, which I help mentor. I wanted to teach the girls about game design and pseudocode, so I included my initial game pseudocode as part of this repository. It clearly changed a little when it came time to write the game, but that is part of the fun of the development process!

Adventure on the Chattooga Trail is inspired by things that actually happened to me while hiking on the Chattooga Trail earlier this year.

The code heavily assumes a benevolent user who always enters input correctly, just for the sake of time spent on error checking.
